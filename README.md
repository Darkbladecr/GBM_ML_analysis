[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Darkbladecr/heart_disease_analysis/master)

We have data which classifies patients as having survived or not along with several demographics and GBM management. We will try to use this data to create a model which can be used to predict if a patient will survive > 12 months. We will first analyze the data and then use a logistic regression (classification) algorithm.
